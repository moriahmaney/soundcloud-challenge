## An Interface of Ice and Fire
This project is the submission by Moriah Maney for SoundCloud's take home project for the Sr Frontend Engineer, Creator Services position. The prompt given is as follows:

As an avid fan of the epic series A Song of Ice and Fire, I have a hard time keeping up with all of the characters who lose their heads. As such, I would like to have an application that can help me track which characters from the series are alive or dead. 


Please provide an application that satisfies the following criteria:

- Uses https://anapioficeandfire.com/ as a data source

- Is built using your tech stack of choice

- The Houses resource from the API (https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses) is paginated by default to 10 results, for these 10 houses please display a list of all of their Sworn Members grouped by house

- For each Sworn Member display their full name and whether they are alive or dead

- If a character is dead, please display the information provided by the API about their death

- If a house has no Sworn Members, please display the message "This house has no sworn members"

- You are welcome to use tools like ChatGPT if that is a part of your daily workflow but please be prepared to defend your choice to use those tools and provide alternate methods if requested on review
